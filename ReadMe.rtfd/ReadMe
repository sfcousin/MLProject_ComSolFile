SFC : 240613
Description of the DataSet

So:

Simulation has been done using comsol. Some cristal with different shape have been placed in the DNP juice. Another cristal has been placed outside to have an idea of the cristal properties by itself
You can found the image in System.png

Parameter used is the simulation are present in the image Parametre.png

GeometryStresse.mph is the Comsol file -> for Arthur

In data. The polarisation of each par of the sample is describe in the single text \
You have three column : \
Column 1 : equilibrium polarisation (i.e if it\'92s low : it\'92s MW OFF, if it\'92s high, it\'92s MW ON) \
Column 2 : time \
Column 3 : Average polarisation
